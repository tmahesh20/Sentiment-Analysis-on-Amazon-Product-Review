# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Product-Review

Description:
            Nowadays the main question while buying products on Online websites like Amazon.com is that if we are getting a genuine product or some cheap copy of that product and to distinguish from that we use reviews given on the product as a bias to check for product quality but what if the reviews are used to scam us into thinking otherwise about a said product. So this is a attempt to check if reviews can be checked if they are geniune or tampared with to give false impression about the product.

Applying sentiment analysis on Amazon's product reviews.
The dataset I will be using is from www.kaggle.com.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.
